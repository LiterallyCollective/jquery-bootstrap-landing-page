Our bodies rely on vitamin A for many purposes, all of which are essential for day-to-day activities and long-term health. When a child lacks this nutrient during the early stages of development, they can get sick, experience stunted growth, go blind and even die. Families with children in developing countries who are struggling with food insecurity are most at risk, because purchasing or growing vitamin A-rich foods isn’t always possible.</span>

                        meaningful options empowering us to make a difference in our own communities and in the lives of
                        people we care about. All opportunities are optional.
